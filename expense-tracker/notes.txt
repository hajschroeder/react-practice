UDEMY REACT PROJECT 1 NOTES

DEFINITIONS:

REACT: A javascript library for building user interfaces (developed by Facebook, made available to the public for free)
COMPONENTS: 
-All user interfaces are made up of COMPONENTS
-COMPONENTS are reuseable 
-COMPONENTS should be simple, do small tasks
    -Don't have components do too much 
-DEF: A COMPONENT is an independent and reusable bit of code 
-As I understand, it is the building blocks of React. The documents within a code that contain the functiosn which are then assembled together. 

REACT uses a DECLARATIVE approach. "Define the desired target state, and let REACT figure out the sctual JS DOM instructions" 

REACT code is just fancy JS code
